        <h3>What are we doing that makes the Switch boot into recovery mode?</h3>
        <p>
          The switch boots into recovery mode (aka RCM) when the “Home” button and the “Volume Up” button are being pressed while booting
          the switch. The issue is that it’s humanly impossible to hold down the “Home” button because the console is looking
          for the “Tegra Home button” not the “Joycon Home button”. Attempting to enter RCM without some sort of modification
          results in the console booting normal because the wanted Home button won’t technically be pressed on the boot.
        </p>
        <h3>Will I want a more permanent modification?</h3>
        <p>
          That’s up to you, but the answer will probably be “yes.” Since there is no untethered method of booting custom firmware on
          versions above 1.0.0, you will need to enter RCM every time you turn your console off and back on if you want to
          use custom firmware.
        </p>
        <h3>What’s the goal?</h3>
        <p>
          The goal is to make the Switch think the Tegra chip home button is being pressed on the initial boot of the console. This
          is done by providing a grounded contact to pad #10 in the right joycon rail. This can be done through a few different
          methods explained below. Some of which require modification of the Joycon.
        </p>
        <h3>Will the Joycon work after modification/will the home button constantly be held down?</h3>
        <p>
          The right Joycon is not actually damaged in these modifications, and they still function with zero issues (minus some possible
          minor ones mentioned later on). The home button is still fully functional and is not considered to be constantly
          being held down, so you won’t need to buy extra Joycons (unless you break them of course).

          This method could damage the pads inside your Joycon rail, especially over extended use.
        </div>
        <p>
          Inside the Nintendo Switch’s right joycon rail there are 10 pads, as shown below:
          <br>
          <div class="text-center">

            </a>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br>The goal in this method is to use any piece of conductive material to bridge pad 10 with a ground. The metal could
          be anything from proper wire, to a paper clip, to a screwdriver. The ground could be any grounded metal, including
          the joycon rail itself, or pads 1, 2, or 7. Make sure you
          <strong>DO NOT contact pad 4 when the console is booting/on</strong>. Pad 4 provides power to the Joycons and will fry
          your console if you bridge to it.

        </div>
        <p>
          This Method is similar to the method 1, but slightly more permanent. Similarly you’re using metal to bridge pad 10 in the
          right Joycon rail to a ground (probably pad 1), image of the pad layout below:
          <br>
          <div class="text-center">
            <a target="_blank" href="https://i.imgur.com/DqbAEjR.jpg">

            </a>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br> The difference here is that you’re using a 3D printed piece of plastic in order to hold the metal that will be
          making the bridge. There are many places you can find model downloads for Jigs, one of which can be found
          <a class="a-table" target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2877484">here</a> or
          <a class="a-table" target="_blank" href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2892320">here</a>. Despite the fact that you can use any piece of metal, it’s highly recommend that you DO NOT use a paperclip
          or other piece of ridged or sharp metal in your jig. It’s best to use a soft metal wire bent into a curve, similar
          to the pins inside the joycon themselves as seen below.
          <br>
          <br>
          <div class="text-center">

            </a>
          </div>
          <br>
          <br> Using a ridged or sharp piece of metal in your jig will likely result in damage to the pads over extended use.
          You can also buy a premade Jig, and in that case the same rules apply, just because someone makes and sells a jig,
          it doesn’t mean they know what they are doing. The Jig shown above can be purchased

          This method will result in the right Joycon being considered in wireless mode even while attached to the Switch 
		  if your Joycons are updated to the 6.0.0 firmware. If this happens and you want to use the console in handheld 
		  mode you can either remove the mod, or put the same mod on the left Joycon resulting in them both acting like 
		  they are in wireless mode while connected to the console (they will still charge).
        </div>
        <p>
          This method DOES NOT require you to open your right Joycon. Looking into the bottom of your right Joycon you should be able
          to see the pins used to connect the Joycon to the Switch. There is an example of the pins from the inside bellow.
          Pin 1 is closest to the controls, and pin 10 is closest to the back of the Joycon.

          </div>
          <br>
          <br> The goal of this method is to put a small thin piece of tin foil into your Joycon so it covers ONLY pins 9 and
          10. Then fold the foil over the back of the rail to tape it in place. This may best be done by taking a 1 in by 1 in piece of foil then folding it multiple times. The Joycon is completely functional while
          this mod is installed, but the other Joycon mods are better, but slightly harder options.

            <h5>Troubleshooting:</h5>
            My right Joycon is no longer working in handheld mode, what do I do? If your Joycons are on fw 6.0.0, or are updated to this
            fw you might run into this issue. This issue is inconsistent and doesn’t happen to everyone, however it can seemingly
            be fixed by unplugging the battery of the Joycon for a few seconds, then plugging it back in. Keep in mind the
            Joycon fw is different than the consoles fw and it needs to be updated manually in the system settings. If that
            doesn’t fix the issue you may have bent the 9th pin too far, in which case simply try again, or bend the pins
            back to normal and use a different method.
